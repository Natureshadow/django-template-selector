Change history for django-templateselector
------------------------------------------

?next?
^^^^^^

* Fixed issue where the "same" template could show up more than once in the
  widget, which wouldn't be possible when using ```get_template``
* If the form field (``TemplateChoiceField``) has only **one** valid template
  option, and the form is unbound (ie: its an **add** form or whatever) then
  pre-select the valid choice. Only happens if the field has ``required=True``

0.1.1
^^^^^^
* First release on PyPI.

0.1.0
^^^^^
* Initial development.
